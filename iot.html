            The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola
            vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance,
            able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.
            Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic
            venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.
            The concept of the "Internet of Things" and the term itself, first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis,
            to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C, published
            in September 1985.<br>
            There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of the IoT, especially in the areas of
            privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun
            including the development of international standards.<br>

            IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air
            conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.[25][26] Long-term benefits could include energy
            savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the
            home aware of usage<br>
            A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
            appliances.[28] For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and
            accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.[29][30] This
            could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.[31] This can be demonstrated in the case
            of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's
            Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.<br>
            standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google
            Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.[32] In addition to the commercial systems, there are
            many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.<br>
            One key application of a smart home is to provide assistance for those with disabilities and elderly
            individuals. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific
            disabilities.[35] Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can
            be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.[36] They can also be equipped
            with additional safety features. <br>
            medical emergencies such as falls or seizures.[37] Smart home technology applied in this way can provide
            users with more freedom and a higher quality of life.[35]

            The term "Enterprise IoT" refers to devices used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is
            estimated that the EIoT will account for 9.1 billion devices.<br>

            The IoT's major significant trend in recent years is the explosive growth of devices connected and
            controlled by the Internet.[104] The wide range of applications for IoT technology mean that the specifics
            can be very different from one device to the next but there are basic characteristics shared by most.<br>
            The IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,
            resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits, and reduced human exertions<br>
            The number of IoT devices increased 31% year-over-year to 8.4 billion in the year 2017[109] and it is
            estimated that there will be 30 billion devices by 2020.[104] The global market value of the IoT is
            projected to reach $7.1 trillion by 2020.<br>
            Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original concept of the Internet of things.
            Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However,
            there is a shift in research (by companies such as Intel) to integrate the concepts of the IoT and
            autonomous control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force
            for autonomous IoT.[111] A promising approach in this context is deep reinforcement learning where most of
            IoT systems provide a dynamic and interactive environment.[112] Training an agent (i.e., IoT device) to
            behave smartly in such an environment cannot be addressed by conventional machine learning algorithms such
            as supervised learning. By reinforcement learning approach, a learning agent can sense the environment's
            state (e.g., sensing home temperature), perform actions (e.g., turn HVAC on or off) and learn through the
            maximizing accumulated rewards it receives in long term.<br>
            IoT intelligence can be offered at three levels: IoT devices, Edge/Fog nodes, and Cloud computing.[113] The
            need for intelligent control and decision at each level depends on the time sensitiveness of the IoT
            application. For example, an autonomous vehicle's camera needs to make real-time obstacle detection to avoid
            an accident. This fast decision making would not be possible through transferring data from the vehicle to
            cloud instances and return the predictions back to the vehicle. Instead, all the operation should be
            performed locally in the vehicle. Integrating advanced machine learning algorithms including deep learning
            into IoT devices is an active research area to make smart objects closer to reality. Moreover, it is
            possible to get the most value out of IoT deployments through analyzing IoT data, extracting hidden
            information, and predicting control decisions. A wide variety of machine learning techniques have been used
            in IoT domain ranging from traditional methods such as regression, support vector machine, and random forest
            to advanced ones such as convolutional neural networks, LSTM, and variational autoencoder<br>
            In the future, the Internet of Things may be a non-deterministic and open network in which auto-organized or
            intelligent entities (web services, SOA components) and virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and
            able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context,
            circumstances or environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context
            information as well as the object's ability to detect changes in the environment (faults affecting sensors)
            and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitutes a major research trend,[115] clearly needed to
            provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a
            variety of different technologies to support such context-aware automation, but more sophisticated forms of
            intelligence are requested to permit sensor units and intelligent cyber-physical systems to be deployed in
            real environments.<br>

        Monitoring and controlling operations of sustainable urban and rural infrastructures like bridges, railway
        tracks and on- and offshore wind-farms is a key application of the IoT.[64] The IoT infrastructure can be used
        for monitoring any events or changes in structural conditions that can compromise safety and increase risk. The
        IoT can benefit the construction industry by cost-saving, time reduction, better quality workday, paperless
        workflow and increase in productivity. It can help in taking faster decisions and save money with Real-Time Data
        Analytics. It can also be used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an efficient manner, by
        coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these facilities.[46] IoT devices can also
        be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships. Usage of IoT devices for
        monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve incident management and emergency response
        coordination, and quality of service, up-times and reduce costs of operation in all infrastructure related
        areas.[71] Even areas such as waste management can benefit[72] from automation and optimization that could be
        brought in by the IoT.
